# Tindarr v2.0.0 (2025-11-15)

The first stable Tindarr release finalizes the move away from the legacy Deno/MovieMatch prototype to a modern Node + React monorepo. The UI, docs, and infrastructure now reflect the new branding while delivering a more maintainable developer experience.

## Highlights

- **Full rebrand to Tindarr.** Repository, docs, and tooling now reference the tindarr identity; new reverse-proxy/docker docs describe the supported deployment patterns.
- **Modernized stack.** React/Vite client and Node/Express server live in npm workspaces with Dockerfile/Compose support and clear env configuration.
- **Improved Plex experience.** Room sharing, shared filters/queues, duration/content rating/year filtering, and correct Plex deep links provide parity with (and improvements over) MovieMatch.
- **Quality gates.** Node CI workflow builds/tests server + client, and Gitleaks scans run on every push/PR.

## Breaking changes

- The old Deno CLI and associated scripts have been removed; use `npm run dev/build/test` within the workspaces instead.
- Environment variables were renamed/re-scoped to match the new architecture (`FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, `VITE_BACKEND_URL`, etc.).
- Docker image names changed to `hestonhamilton/tindarr`.

## Upgrade notes

1. Re-clone the repo from `https://github.com/hestonhamilton/tindarr.git` or update your remote origin.
2. Copy the new `.env.example` files under `packages/server` and `packages/client`, and review `docs/configuration.md`.
3. Use `npm install` at the repo root to hydrate all workspaces, then `npm run dev` to launch both services.
4. If you previously scripted releases with Deno, switch to the GitHub Actions workflow or run the Dockerfile included here.

## Release checklist

1. Ensure CI is green on the release branch.
2. Update `VERSION` and docs/CHANGELOG as needed (this file for v2.0.0).
3. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Tindarr v2.0.0"
   git push origin v2.0.0
   ```
4. The `Release` workflow will build the client/server, publish artifacts, and push Docker images automatically.
